Connect your WordPress and WooCommerce store to Alpha SMS for OTP verification and order notifications in Bangladesh.

== Description ==

= Overview =
Alpha SMS makes it easy to add SMS-based two-factor authentication and transactional notifications to your WordPress site. Replace unreliable email-based logins with one-time passwords, confirm customer phone numbers during registration, and keep shoppers updated with automated WooCommerce order status messages that are verified in order notes.

= Key Features =
* OTP verification for WordPress and WooCommerce registration and login forms.
* WooCommerce order status notifications for customers and administrators, including custom statuses registered in WooCommerce.
* Bulk SMS campaign tool for WordPress and WooCommerce users or custom phone lists.
* Message templates that can be tailored directly from the WordPress admin.
* Built specifically for Bangladeshi mobile operators using the Alpha SMS gateway.

= How It Works =
1. A user submits a supported form (registration, login, or checkout).
2. Alpha SMS sends a one-time password (OTP) to the provided Bangladeshi mobile number.
3. The OTP is validated before the registration, login, or checkout process is completed.
4. WooCommerce stores can optionally send transactional order notifications to customers and administrators.

= Requirements =
* An active Alpha SMS account and API key from https://sms.net.bd/.
* WooCommerce 3.0+ for eCommerce-specific features (optional for OTP-only usage).

== Installation ==

= From your WordPress dashboard =
1. Visit `Plugins > Add New`.
2. Search for `Alpha SMS`, then install the plugin.
3. Activate the plugin from your Plugins page.
4. Navigate to `Alpha SMS` in the WordPress admin menu and add your API credentials.
5. Enable OTP flows, WooCommerce notifications, or campaigns as needed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which forms are supported right now? =
Alpha SMS currently works with the default WordPress registration form, the WordPress login form, the WooCommerce registration form, the WooCommerce checkout form, and the WooCommerce login form.

= Do I need an Alpha SMS account? =
Yes. You must have an Alpha SMS account with available credits in order to send OTPs and notifications. Enter your API key and token in the plugin settings to connect your site.

= Does the plugin work without WooCommerce? =
Yes. OTP verification for WordPress and WooCommerce registration and login works independently of WooCommerce. OTP data is stored with WordPress transients, so WooCommerce sessions are not required. WooCommerce is only needed if you want order notifications or checkout verification.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.19 =
* Fixed OTP forms not initializing on WooCommerce login and registration pages when jQuery is deferred by the theme or optimization plugins.
* Wrapped public JavaScript in a jQuery IIFE to prevent global scope pollution and conflicts with other plugins.
* Moved public script to load in the footer to guarantee jQuery availability.
* Fixed form traversal using .closest() instead of .parent() so OTP event handlers bind correctly regardless of DOM nesting.
* Fixed XSS vulnerability in error and success message rendering by using safe DOM element creation instead of raw HTML injection.

= 1.0.18 =
* Added support for customer SMS templates on custom WooCommerce order statuses exposed through WooCommerce runtime status registration.
* Trimmed Sender ID before saving so whitespace-only values are stored as empty.
* Refreshed WooCommerce customer notification settings to render status templates dynamically.

= 1.0.17 =
* Save verified registration phone numbers to user profile metadata for OTP login reuse.
* Scope registration nonce checks to form POSTs so user meta sync runs on hook calls.

* Aggregated campaign job results into concise admin notices that highlight failed numbers and the most recent error.

= 1.0.11 =
* Updated the WooCommerce checkout OTP workflow to clone whichever submit button is present instead of relying on the `#place_order` ID so guest checkout themes remain compatible.
* Simplified OTP storage to rely solely on WordPress transients instead of WooCommerce sessions.
* Added a WordPress transient-based OTP fallback for sites without WooCommerce while removing the unused session bootstrapper.
* Refreshed plugin documentation and guidance in the readme.
* Added a guest checkout OTP rate limit of four requests per fifteen minutes to prevent abuse.
